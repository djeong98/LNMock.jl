# Package Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to make LNMock.jl a proper Julia package.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Added Compat Entries (Project.toml)
**Issue**: Missing version constraints for dependencies in `[compat]` section.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive compatibility constraints:
```toml
[compat]
Dierckx = "0.5"
Distributions = "0.25"
FFTW = "1.4"
FLoops = "0.2"
HDF5 = "0.16, 0.17"
Interpolations = "0.14, 0.15"
Logging = "1.11"
MPI = "0.20"
PencilFFTs = "0.13, 0.14, 0.15"
Preferences = "1.3"
cosmology = "1"
julia = "1.9"
```

### 2. Fixed Circular Include (src/LNMock.jl)
**Issue**: `__init__.jl` was included before `load_backend()` function was defined.

**Fix**: Moved `include(joinpath(@__DIR__,"__init__.jl"))` to after the `load_backend()` function definition.

### 3. Made Backend Loading Conditional (src/BackendDispatch.jl, src/__init__.jl)
**Issue**: MPI and PencilFFTs backends were always loaded, causing failures when not installed.

**Fix**:
- Changed `BackendDispatch.jl` to only always load FFTW backends
- Made PencilFFTs_MPI module a placeholder that gets populated at runtime
- Added runtime checks in `__init__.jl` to verify MPI/PencilFFTs availability before loading
- Moved MPI function imports to runtime when `:pencil_mpi` backend is selected

### 4. Removed Hard MPI Dependency (src/Core.jl, src/Utils/Utils.jl)
**Issue**: `Core.jl` had `using MPI` at module level, failing when MPI not installed.

**Fix**:
- Removed `using MPI` from Core module
- Created `_get_MPI()` helper function that loads MPI from Main on demand
- Updated all MPI function calls to use `_get_MPI()` or local `MPI = _get_MPI()`
- Modified utility functions to dynamically load MPI only when comm !== nothing

### 5. Fixed Undefined Variable Bug (src/Core.jl:684)
**Issue**: Variable `comm` was used instead of `cfg.comm` in run_lognormal.

**Fix**: Changed to `cfg.comm` throughout the function.

## Minor Issues Fixed

### 6. Removed Old Code (src/Core_old.jl)
Deleted unused backup file.

### 7. Replaced Korean Comments (src/Core.jl)
**Issue**: Comments in Korean made code less accessible internationally.

**Fix**: Translated comments to English:
- "MPI를 사용하는 경우" → "When using MPI"
- "단일 프로세스인 경우" → "Single process case"

### 8. Removed Manifest.toml
**Issue**: Packages should not track `Manifest.toml` in version control.

**Fix**: Deleted `Manifest.toml` and added to `.gitignore`.

### 9. Created README.md
Added comprehensive package documentation including:
- Installation instructions
- Quick start guide
- Backend selection
- Configuration options
- Examples
- Requirements

### 10. Added .gitignore
Created proper `.gitignore` file to exclude:
- `Manifest.toml`
- Build artifacts
- FFT wisdom files
- Output files
- Editor-specific files

## Technical Details

### MPI Conditional Loading Pattern

The package now uses a lazy loading pattern for MPI:

```julia
function _get_MPI()
    if !isdefined(Main, :MPI)
        error("MPI not available. Please use :pencil_mpi backend or load MPI.jl")
    end
    return Main.MPI
end
```

This function is called only when:
1. A comm object is not nothing
2. MPI operations are needed

### Backend Initialization Flow

1. Package loads → LNMock module loads
2. `__init__()` runs
3. Check `LN_BACKEND` environment variable
4. If `:pencil_mpi`:
   - Verify MPI and PencilFFTs are available
   - Load them dynamically with `@eval using MPI`
   - Include backend implementation
   - Define helper functions
5. User can now use MPI backend safely

### Cosmology Package

Note: `cosmology` package was already in dependencies but is used correctly throughout.

## Testing Recommendations

Before releasing as a package, test:

1. **Without MPI**: `using LNMock` should work with default FFTW backends
2. **With MPI**: Set `LN_BACKEND=pencil_mpi` and verify MPI backend loads
3. **Package installation**: Test `Pkg.add(url="...")` workflow
4. **Documentation**: Verify README examples work
5. **Different Julia versions**: Test on Julia 1.9, 1.10, 1.11

## Remaining Recommendations

1. Add unit tests in `test/runtests.jl`
2. Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
3. Add LICENSE file
4. Consider registering in Julia General registry
5. Add more detailed API documentation (docstrings)
6. Create example scripts in `examples/` directory
